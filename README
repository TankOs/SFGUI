                                     SFGUI
                             GUI library for SFML 2
                     zlib license (see LICENSE for details)


1. INSTALLING

Dependencies:
  - SFML Git (http://sfml-dev.org/)

The build system in use is CMake (http://cmake.org/). It's available for all
major platforms.

To build, perform the following steps:

  - cmake .
  - make install (as root)
  - On Linux: ldconfig (as root)


2. USING SFGUI IN OWN PROJECTS

To use SFGUI in your projects, you have to link to the SFGUI library (see 1.
for building). Also make sure that your compiler is able to find SFGUI's
include directory.

If you're using CMake for your project and you've properly installed SFGUI (see
1.), you can automate the process of finding SFGUI. At first copy the file
cmake/FindSFGUI.cmake to your CMake's module directory. Then add the following
to your project's CMakeLists.txt file:

  find_package( SFGUI REQUIRED )
  include_directories( ${SFGUI_INCLUDE_DIR} )
  add_executable( my_program ... )
  target_link_libraries( my_program ... ${SFGUI_LIBRARY} )

In case CMake can't find your SFGUI installation, you can still specify the
path manually by setting the SFGUI_ROOT CMake variable.

Keep in mind that you still have to link to SFML (at least system, windows and
graphics).


3. DOCUMENTATION

You can find the API documentation in the doc sub-directory. Create it with
Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).

It's also available online at http://sfgui.sfml-dev.de/doxygen/
